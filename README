Stuff
=====

Useful scripts and small programs for everyday workflow. Mostly developed for
Mac OSX or Linux environments. Both where possible and/or I can be bothered.
Check each directory's README.

Things included:

- powerbtnd
	A daemon (to be run via systemd) to detect the power button being pressed
	and gracefully shutdown; whatever that means.
- notesc
	This program is intended to compile (Pandoc) markdown documents, university
	notes, into PDFs.
- general scripts
	Includes some useful, general, and simple scripts.
- cmail
	A simple command line program that sends emails. Can take options or use
	environment variables
- LaTeX
	Some LaTeX files I often use. E.g., cmath, which is a handy but tiny maths
	library.
- netmonitor
	A simple program that will ping all listed addresses & email any that fail.
